/*
 * Registers the Service Worker for the app.
 *
 * - onNeedRefresh(): Triggered when a new version of the app is available.
 *   The service worker has updated files ready, but they won't apply until
 *   the page is refreshed. Here we simply log a message, but you can replace
 *   it with a UI prompt (e.g., a toast/button) to let the user refresh.
 *
 * - onOfflineReady(): Triggered when the app is fully cached and can run
 *   offline. This means the required assets have been stored and the user
 *   can now access the app without internet.
 *
 * Overall, this helps the app behave like a PWA â€” supporting offline use
 * and detecting updates for smoother user experience.
